# Fintech Focus Project: A Guide to your Well-Being

# Project Description

'A Guide to your Well-Being' is a full-stack web application that consists of multiple pages, detailing on exercise, nutrition, and mental health, and a Diet Calculator quiz. The front-end of the application was created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, while Python and Flask were used to integrate the back-end portion (taught during the Fintech Focus Program). These technologies were used to provide an experience using languages commonly used by various financial institutions.  

Some challenges we faced were:
- Creating the drop-down button and redirecting the web page as per the userâ€™s selection. 
- Displaying the results of the Diet Calculator Quiz.
- Creating the Request Form on the Contact Us page. 

In the future, we would like to improve the application by:
- Building a feature to send requests to emails from the Contact Us page. 
- Adding a search bar in the navigation bar.
- Implementing a chatbot on the Mental Health Page. 
- Using a Geographic Information System to locate fitness centers and health clinics near the user. 
- Creating a mobile friendly version of the application.

# Using the Project

Follow the pages using the navigation bar to explore nutrition, fitness, and mental health tips. Some considerations to keep in mind while using the website are:
- Clicking anything that is part of the footer will simply direct you to the top of the page.
- The text of the items on the Nutrition page needs to be clicked to display new pages. The Nutrition Guide and Nutrition Video items directly connected to external links that open within the same tab. 
- The Spotify widget can be used within the Mental Health webpage and will not open a separate tab. 
- The resources provided on the Mental Health page (the white text) are links that will redirect to external links within the same tab. 
- The Frequently Asked Questions page accordion layout does not allow for a second click to close a specific section.
